  # required to know which system to interface with
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  name = "Asynchronous"
}
```

- `name` (String) SnapmirrorPolicy name

### Read-Only

- `comment` (String) Comment associated with the policy.

### Nested Schema for `retention`

Read-Only:

- `count` (Number) Number of Snapshot copies to be kept for retention.
