# Resource licensing_license

Add/Remove License from ONTAP

### Related ONTAP commands
* system license add
* system license delete

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netapp-ontap_cluster_licensing_license_resource" "cluster_licensing_license" {
  # required to know which system to interface with
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  keys            = ["testme"]
}

```

## Argument Reference

### Required

- `cx_profile_name` (String) Connection profile name
- `keys` (Set of String) List of NLF or 26-character keys

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `name` (String) Name of the license
- `scope` (String) Scope of the license
- `serial_number` (String)
- `state` (String) State of the license

## Import
This resource supports import, which allows you to reference an existing license by name. Import requires a unique ID composed of the license name and connection profile

id = `{License name},{cx_profile_name}`

### Terraform Import
```shell
terraform import netapp-ontap_cluster_licensing_license_resource.import_license fcp,cluster5
```

!> The terraform import CLI command can only import resources into the state. Importing via the CLI does not generate configuration. If you want to generate the accompanying configuration for imported resources, use the import block instead.

### Terraform Import Block
This requires Terraform 1.5 or higher, and will auto create the configuration for you.

First create the import block

```terrafrom
import {
  to = netapp-ontap_cluster_licensing_license_resource.license_import
  id = "FCP,cluster4"
}
```

Next run terraform plan to generate the configuration for you
    
```shell
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
```

This will generate a file called generated.tf that will contain the configuration block for the imported resource.
Keys are not stored in the state file, so a fake key is generated for you.

```terraform
# __generated__ by Terraform
# Please review these resources and move them into your main configuration files.

# __generated__ by Terraform from "FCP,cluster4"
resource "netapp-ontap_cluster_licensing_license_resource" "license_import" {
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  keys            = ["fake"]
}
```
