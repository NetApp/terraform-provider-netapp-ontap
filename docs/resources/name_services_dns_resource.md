# Resource DNS

Create/Modify/Delete and Import a name services DNS resource

### Related ONTAP commands
```commandline
* vserver services name-service dns create
* vserver services name-service dns create
* vserver services name-service dns show
* vserver services name-service dns delete
```

## Supported Platforms
* On-perm ONTAP system 9.6 or higher
* Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

[comment]: <> (TODO: Add support for Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP )

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "netapp-ontap_name_services_dns_resource" "name_services_dns" {
  # required to know which system to interface with
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  svm_name = "testSVM"
  name_servers = ["1.1.1.1", "2.2.2.2"]
  dns_domains = ["foo.bar.com", "boo.bar.com"]
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Argument Reference

### Required

- `cx_profile_name` (String) Connection profile name
- `svm_name` (String) IPInterface svm name

### Optional

- `dns_domains` (Set of String) List of DNS domains such as 'sales.bar.com'. The first domain is the one that the svm belongs to
- `name_servers` (Set of String) List of IPv4 addresses of name servers such as '123.123.123.123'.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) UUID of svm

## Import
This resource supports import, which allows you to import existing name services DNS resources into the state.
Import require a unique ID composed of the svm name and the connection profile name.

id = svm_name,cx_profile_name
### Terraform import
terraform import netapp-ontap_name_services_dns_resource.`name` `svm_name`,`cx_profile_name`
* name -- name you want to give the resource in terraform
* svm_name -- name of the svm the resource belongs to
* cx_profile_name -- name of the connection profile to use

For example
```shell
 terraform import netapp-ontap_name_services_dns_resource.dns_import ansibleSVM,cluster4
```

!> The terraform import CLI command can only import resources into the state. Importing via the CLI does not generate configuration. If you want to generate the accompanying configuration for imported resources, use the import block instead.

### Terraform import block
This requires Terraform 1.5 or higher, and will auto create the configuration for you

First create the import block
```terraform
import {
  to = netapp-ontap_name_services_dns_resource.dns_import
  id = "svm1,cluster4"
}
```
Next run, this will auto create the configuration for you
```shell
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
```
The auto generated configuration will look like this
```terraform
# __generated__ by Terraform
# Please review these resources and move them into your main configuration files.

# __generated__ by Terraform from "svm1,cluster4"
resource "netapp-ontap_name_services_dns_resource" "dns_import" {
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  dns_domains     = ["test.com", "test1.com"]
  name_servers    = ["1.2.3.4", "3.4.5.6"]
  svm_name        = "svm1"
}
```
