## Import
This resource supports import, which allows you to import existing security account into the state of this resource.
Import require a unique ID composed of the security account name and connection profile, separated by a comma.

id = `name`, `cx_profile_name`

### Terraform Import

 For example
 ```shell
  terraform import netapp-ontap_security_account.act_import acc_user,cluster4
 ```

### Terraform Import Block
This requires Terraform 1.5 or higher, and will auto create the configuration for you

First create the block
```terraform
import {
  to = netapp-ontap_security_account.act_import
  id = "acc_user,cluster4"
}
```
Next run, this will auto create the configuration for you
```shell
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
```
This will generate a file called generated.tf, which will contain the configuration for the imported resource
```terraform
# __generated__ by Terraform
# Please review these resources and move them into your main configuration files.
# __generated__ by Terraform from "acc_user,cluster4"
resource "netapp-ontap_security_account" "act_import" {
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  name       = "acc_user"
  applications = [
    {
      application = "http"
      authentication_methods = ["password"]
      second_authentication_method = "none"
    }
  ]
  comment         = null
  locked          = false
  owner = {
    name = "abccluster-1"
  }
  password = null # sensitive
  role = {
    name = "admin"
  }
  second_authentication_method = null
}
```
