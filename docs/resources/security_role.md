## Schema

### Required

- `cx_profile_name` (String) Connection profile name
- `name` (String) SecurityRole name

### Optional

- `privileges` (Attributes Set) The list of privileges that this role has been granted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--privileges))
- `svm_name` (String) SecurityRole svm name

### Read-Only

- `builtin` (Boolean) Indicates if this is a built-in (pre-defined) role which cannot be modified or deleted.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the security role.
- `scope` (String) Scope of the entity. Set to 'cluster' for cluster owned objects and to 'svm' for SVM owned objects.

### Nested Schema for `privileges`

Optional:

- `access` (String) Access level for the REST endpoint or command/command directory path. If it denotes the access level for a command/command directory path, the only supported enum values are 'none','readonly' and 'all'.
- `path` (String) Either of REST URI/endpoint OR command/command directory path.
- `query` (String) Optional attribute that can be specified only if the 'path' attribute refers to a command/command directory path. The privilege tuple implicitly defines a set of objects the role can or cannot access at the specified access level. The query further reduces this set of objects to a subset of objects that the role is allowed to access. The query attribute must be applicable to the command/command directory specified by the 'path' attribute. It is defined using one or more parameters of the command/command directory path specified by the 'path' attribute.
