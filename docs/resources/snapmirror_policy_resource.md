# Resoruce netapp-ontap_snapmirror_policy_resource

Create/Modify/Delete a snapmirror policy resource

## Example Usage
```
# Create a basic snapmirror policy
resource "netapp-ontap_snapmirror_policy_resource" "snapmirror_policy_basic_async1" {
  # required to know which system to interface with
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  name = "test_async_basic"
  svm_name = "testSVM"
}

# Create a basic sync type snapmirror policy
resource "netapp-ontap_snapmirror_policy_resource" "snapmirror_policy_basic_sync1" {
  # required to know which system to interface with
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  name = "test_sync_basic"
  svm_name = "testSVM"
  type = "sync"
  sync_type = "sync"
}

# Create a async type snapmirror policy with retention rules
resource "netapp-ontap_snapmirror_policy_resource" "snapmirror_policy_async" {
  # required to know which system to interface with
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  name = "test_async_retention"
  svm_name = "testSVM"
  type = "async"
  retention = [{
    label = "weekly"
    count = 2
  },
  {
    label = "daily",
    count = 7
  },
  {
    label = "newlabel1",
    count = 3
  }
  ]
}

# Create a sync type snapmirror policy with retntion a rule
resource "netapp-ontap_snapmirror_policy_resource" "snapmirror_policy_sync" {
  # required to know which system to interface with
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  name = "test_sync_retention"
  svm_name = "testSVM"
  comment = "test comment"
  type = "sync"
  sync_type = "sync"
  retention = [{
    count = 1
    label = "weekly"
  }
  ]
}

## Schema

### Required

- `cx_profile_name` (String) Connection profile name
- `name` (String) SnapmirrorPolicy name
- `svm_name` (String) SnapmirrorPolicy svm name

### Optional

- `comment` (String) Comment associated with the policy.
- `copy_all_source_snapshots` (Boolean) Specifies that all the source Snapshot copies (including the one created by SnapMirror before the transfer begins) should be copied to the destination on a transfer.
- `copy_latest_source_snapshot` (Boolean) Specifies that the latest source Snapshot copy (created by SnapMirror before the transfer begins) should be copied to the destination on a transfer. 'Retention' properties cannot be specified along with this property. This is applicable only to async policies. Property can only be set to 'true'.
- `create_snapshot_on_source` (Boolean) Specifies that all the source Snapshot copies (including the one created by SnapMirror before the transfer begins) should be copied to the destination on a transfer.
- `identity_preservation` (String) Specifies which configuration of the source SVM is replicated to the destination SVM.
- `network_compression_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether network compression is enabled for transfers.
- `retention` (Attributes List) Rules for Snapshot copy retention. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--retention))
- `sync_type` (String) SnapmirrorPolicy sync type. [sync, strict_sync, automated_failover]
- `transfer_schedule_name` (String) The schedule used to update asynchronous relationships.
- `type` (String) SnapmirrorPolicy type. [async, sync, continuous]

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--retention"></a>
### Nested Schema for `retention`

Required:

- `label` (String) Snapshot copy label

Optional:

- `count` (Number) Number of Snapshot copies to be kept for retention.
- `creation_schedule_name` (String) Schedule used to create Snapshot copies on the destination for long term retention.
- `prefix` (String) Specifies the prefix for the Snapshot copy name to be created as per the schedule
