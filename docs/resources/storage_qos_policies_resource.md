# netapp-ontap_qos_policies (Resource)

Create/Modify/Delete a QOSPolicies resource

### Related ONTAP commands
```commandline
* qos policy-group create
* qos policy-group modify
* qos policy-group delete
* qos adaptive-policy-group create
* qos adaptive-policy-group modify
* qos adaptive-policy-group delete
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netapp-ontap_qos_policies" "qos_policies" {
  # required to know which system to interface with
  cx_profile_name = "cluster1"
  name = "terraform2"
  svm_name = "terraform"
  fixed = {
    max_throughput_iops = 1
  }
}
```

- `name` (String) QOSPolicies name
- `svm_name` (String) QOSPolicies svm name

### Optional

- `fixed` (Attributes) Fixed QoS policy (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--fixed))
- `scope` (String) QoS policy scope

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) QOSPolicies UUID

<a id="nestedatt--adaptive"></a>
### Nested Schema for `adaptive`

- `peak_iops` (Number) Peak IOPS

Optional:

- `absolute_min_iops` (Number) Absolute minimum IOPS
- `block_size` (String) Block size
- `expected_iops_allocation` (String) Expected IOPS allocation
- `peak_iops_allocation` (String) Peak IOPS allocation


<a id="nestedatt--fixed"></a>
### Nested Schema for `fixed`

Optional:

- `capacity_shared` (Boolean) Capacity shared
- `max_throughput_iops` (Number) Maximum throughput in IOPS
- `max_throughput_mbps` (Number) Maximum throughput in MBPS
- `min_throughput_iops` (Number) Minimum throughput in IOPS
- `min_throughput_mbps` (Number) Minimum throughput in MBPS

## Import
This Resource supports import, which allows you to import existing qos policies into the state of this resoruce.
Import require a unique ID composed of the name, svm name and cx_profile_name, separated by a comma.

id = `name`, `svm_name`, `cx_profile_name`

### Terraform Import

For example
 ```shell
  terraform import netapp-ontap_qos_policies.example name,svm,cluster4
 ```

!> The terraform import CLI command can only import resources into the state. Importing via the CLI does not generate configuration. If you want to generate the accompanying configuration for imported resources, use the import block instead.

### Terraform Import Block
This requires Terraform 1.5 or higher, and will auto create the configuration for you

First create the block
```terraform
import {
  to = netapp-ontap_qos_policies.qos_policies
  id = "name,svm,cluster4"
}
```
Next run, this will auto create the configuration for you
```shell
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
```
This will generate a file called generated.tf, which will contain the configuration for the imported resource
```terraform
# __generated__ by Terraform
# Please review these resources and move them into your main configuration files.

# __generated__ by Terraform from "vol,svm,tree,test,cluster4"
resource "netapp-ontap_qos_policies" "qos_policies" {
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  id = "abcd"
  adaptive = {
    absolute_min_iops = 0
    block_size = ""
    expected_iops = 0
    expected_iops_allocation = ""
    peak_iops = 0
    peak_iops_allocation = ""
  }
  fixed = {
    capacity_shared = true
    max_throughput_iops = 0
    max_throughput_mbps = 0
    min_throughput_iops = 0
    min_throughput_mbps = 0
  }
  name = "test"
  scope = "svm"
  svm_name = "terraform"
}
```
