# netapp-ontap_volume_file (Resource)

Create/Modify/Delete a VolumeFile resource

## Supported Platforms
* On-perm ONTAP system 9.6 or higher
* Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netapp-ontap_volume_file" "volume_files" {
  # required to know which system to interface with
  cx_profile_name = "cluster1"
  path = "vol4"
  volume_name = "terraform"
  svm_name = "terraform"
  type = "directory"
  unix_permissions = "755"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cx_profile_name` (String) Connection profile name
- `path` (String) Relative path of a file or directory in the volume
- `svm_name` (String) Name of the svm to use
- `volume_name` (String) Volume name

### Optional

- `byte_offset` (Number) The number of bytes used
- `name` (String) The name of the file or directory
- `overwrite` (Boolean) Whether the file can be overwritten
- `type` (String) The type of the file or directory
- `unix_permissions` (Number) UNIX permissions to be viewed as an octal number

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) VolumeFile path is used as ID here
- `size` (Number) The size of the file or directory

## Import
This Resource supports import, which allows you to import existing volume files into the state of this resoruce.
Import require a unique ID composed of the volume_name, svm_name, path and cx_profile_name, separated by a comma.

 id = `volume_name`,`svm_name`, `path`, `cx_profile_name`

### Terraform Import

 For example
 ```shell
  terraform import netapp-ontap_volume_file.example vol2,svm1,path,cluster4
 ```

!> The terraform import CLI command can only import resources into the state. Importing via the CLI does not generate configuration. If you want to generate the accompanying configuration for imported resources, use the import block instead.

### Terraform Import Block
This requires Terraform 1.5 or higher, and will auto create the configuration for you

First create the block
```terraform
import {
  to = netapp-ontap_volume_file.files_import
  id = "vol1,svm1,path,cluster4"
}
```
Next run, this will auto create the configuration for you
```shell
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
```
This will generate a file called generated.tf, which will contain the configuration for the imported resource
```terraform
# __generated__ by Terraform
# Please review these resources and move them into your main configuration files.
# __generated__ by Terraform from "vol1,svm1,vol3,cluster4"
resource "netapp-ontap_volume_file" "files_import" {
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  volume_name       = "vol1"
  svm_name = "svm1"
  id = "vol3"
  path = "vol3"
  size = 4096
  type = "directory"
  unix_permissions = 755
}
```
