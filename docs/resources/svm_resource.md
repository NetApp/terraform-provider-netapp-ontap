# Resource SVM

Create/Modify/Delete a SVM 

### Related ONTAP commands
* vserver create
* vserver modify
* vserver delete

## Example Usage

This creates a new SVM called `tfsvm4`. In IPspace `terafromIpspace_newname`, which can have up to 200 volumes which will be cased on aggr2
```terraform
resource "netapp-ontap_svm_resource" "example" {
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  name = "tfsvm4"
  ipspace = "terafromIpspace_newname"
  comment = "test"
  snapshot_policy = "default-1weekly"
  language = "en_us.utf_8"
  aggregates = ["aggr2"]
  max_volumes = "200"
}`
```

## Argument Reference

### Required

- `cx_profile_name` (String) Connection profile name
- `name` (String) The name of the svm to manage

### Optional

- `aggregates` (Set of String) Aggregates to be assigned use for svm
- `comment` (String) Comment for svm to be created
- `ipspace` (String) The name of the ipspace to manage
- `language` (String) Language to use for svm
- `max_volumes` (String) Maximum number of volumes that can be created on the svm. Expects an integer or unlimited
- `snapshot_policy` (String) The name of the snapshot policy to manage
- `subtype` (String) The subtype for svm to be created

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) svm identifier

## Import
This resource supports import, which allows you to import existing svms into the state of this resource.
Import require a unique ID composed of the svm name, and connection profile, separated by a comma.

id = `name`,`cx_profile_name`

### Terraform Import

For example
```shell
 terraform import netapp-ontap_storage_svm_resource.example svm1,cluster5
```
!> The terraform import CLI command can only import resources into the state. Importing via the CLI does not generate configuration. If you want to generate the accompanying configuration for imported resources, use the import block instead.

### Terrafomr Import Block
This requires Terraform 1.5 or higher, and will auto create the configuration for you

First create the block
```terraform
import {
  to = netapp-ontap_storage_svm_resource.svm_import
  id = "svm1,cluster4"
}
```
Next run, this will auto create the configuration for you
```shell
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
```
This will generate a file called generated.tf, which will contain the configuration for the imported resource
```terraform
# __generated__ by Terraform
# Please review these resources and move them into your main configuration files.
# __generated__ by Terraform from "svm1_root,svm1,cluster4"
resource "netapp-ontap_storage_svm_resource" "svm_import" {
  aggregates = [
    {
      name = "aggr1"
    },
    {
      name = "aggr2"
    },
    {
      name = "aggr3"
    },
  ]
  comment = "testing import"
  cx_profile_name = "cluster4"
  ipspace = "Default"
  language = "c.utf_8"
  max_volumes = "unlimited"
  name = "testImport"
  snapshot_policy = "default"
  subtype = "default"
}
```
